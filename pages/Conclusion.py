        The SVR model performed even worse, essentially failing completely with negative predictive power. Even with sentiment analysis and historical data, memecoins proved extremely difficult to predict because they're driven by unpredictable factors like:

        - Celebrity tweets and endorsements  
        - Market manipulation
        - Sudden community-driven rallies
        - Random speculation bubbles
        
        **Key Takeaway**: While we confirmed that social media sentiment correlates with price movements, turning that correlation into reliable price predictions proved nearly impossible.

        1. **Sentiment-Price Nexus**: There is an undeniable direct correlation between social media sentiment spikes and memecoin price movements, with sentiment often serving as a leading indicator.

        4. **Volatility Characteristics**: The market exhibits extreme volatility patterns with no consistent long-term directional trends, driven primarily by cyclical hype periods and social media amplification rather than traditional market fundamentals.
        
        5. **Community vs. Mainstream Appeal**: Success in the memecoin space depends heavily on building dedicated communities (Reddit) while also achieving mainstream viral moments (Twitter).
        
        6. **Prediction Impossibility**: Advanced machine learning models, including Random Forest and SVR, demonstrate that memecoin price movements are largely unpredictable, with even the best models explaining less than 17% of price variance.
